This is my Final Year project that i made with one of my classmate as a group project. Its a deep fake detector which implements machine learning model via flask application. It uses InceptionResnet model which is trained on the vggface2 open dataset to differentiate between the real and fake images with the sigmoid function for thresholding the difference.
